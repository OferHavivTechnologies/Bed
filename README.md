# My Bed Project

Welcome to my project, the idea of this project came out after i find myself sleeping in V shape in my adjustable bed.
This bed is the best i ever had but only one problem, no timer...

at this point i decide to resolve it - at lease personally. I start learning electronics, Arduino, netowrk and other stuff and build this project on GitHub.

You can see the [Project's master plan](https://github.com/oferhaviv/Bed/wiki/Project's-Master-Plan)

someday i will build a landing page :) [GitHub Pages](http://oferhaviv.github.io/Bed )
